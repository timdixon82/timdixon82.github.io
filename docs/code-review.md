# Code Review and Penetration Test: timdixon82.github.io

Reviewer: Jed (penetration tester and code reviewer)
Date: <date>
Branch reviewed: <branch>
Scope: OWASP Top 10 mapping, front-end security practice

## Scope and method

Describe the files and scope reviewed, and whether automated scanners (Semgrep, Trivy) were run alongside the manual review.

## Confirmed absences (no finding)

List checklist items that were checked and found to be absent or correctly handled:

- No external scripts, stylesheets, or fonts loaded without Subresource Integrity
- No use of `eval`, `Function` constructor, `outerHTML`, or `insertAdjacentHTML`
- No hard-coded secrets, API keys, tokens, or passwords
- No mixed content (HTTP resources on an HTTPS page)
- No unvalidated URL parameters or Web Storage reads
- No external links missing `rel="noopener noreferrer"`
- A Content Security Policy is present and correctly scoped (OWASP A03: Injection)

## Findings

List each finding with: severity, OWASP category, location, description, and recommended fix. If there are no findings, state that explicitly.

## Summary

Summarise the overall security posture: finding counts by severity, and the priority order for fixes.

### Findings by severity
